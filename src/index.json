        "text": "We have a fantastic line up now confirmed, looking at various aspects of serverless. We have a focus on Event Driven Architecture including practical examples and a look at open standards around it. We hear a fascinating story of a successful startup with a focus on sustainability. We hear how well known brands have embraced serverless and the lessons they can teach us, from central government, to e-commerce and media. We mix this up with stories on how to grow as a serverless engineer, a positioning from extensive research into the security of serverless components, and a look at generative AI. Finally, we end with two different perspectives on how organisations today can adopt serverless to get the benefits it needs. \n\r We hope the 2023 edition of ServerlessDays Cardiff will have something for everyone.",
