            "title": "The Evolution of BBC Online",
            "abstract" : "The technical stacks that power the BBCs websites and apps are in constant evolution, and following a move to the cloud and microservices prior to 2020, the next evolution has been to make significant use of serverless technologies, particularly AWS Lambda, which is becoming our dominant form of compute. \n\r  In this talk, join Matt and Craig (Engineering Manager and Lead Tech Architect) where they will discuss how, where, and why the BBC is using serverless so heavily, what has changed, what was learned, and how (they think) this will progress in the future."
