      "description": "After 10 years of working in healthcare management, a serendipitous 20-minute car ride with Kara Swisher inspired Farrah to make the jump into technology. She has worked at multiple startups in many different capacities, eventually working her way to being the Ecosystems Director for Stackery in Portland, Oregon. She is known for not only her ability to get things done but her track-record of accomplishing lofty goals in creative, dynamic ways with an infectious smile. Her passion lies in influencing outcomes and driving projects with multiple stakeholders, priorities, and personalities towards a common goal. She will be the first to tell you how much she loves the chaos and challenges that tech provides. Farrah has shaped a unique story and career that supports her passion for fostering genuine, vibrant communities. She aims to re-define the experience of “providing a service” with a no bs attitude and lots of compassion.",
