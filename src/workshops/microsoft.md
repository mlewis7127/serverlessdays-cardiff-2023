# Serverless Security Workshop

In this workshop we'll deploy a simple Serverless application to Microsoft Azure, but there's a problem, it has a few security gaps that need addressing. That's our job to fix. We'll implement security best practices, to improve our application's security posture, and protect it from potential threats.
