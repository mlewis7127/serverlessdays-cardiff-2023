# Build your first cloud native website with static web apps and serverless APIs

Building apps that scale without needing lots of dev and operations work is a great way to be more productive and deliver business value more quickly. In this workshop, we'll first introduce you to the key technologies in play and then guide you through a hands-on lab taking you through the building of a website, it's data tier, and the connections between the two. We'll show how serverless tech minimises the amount of code you need to write to do amazing things. You'll need your laptop and an Azure subscription (we'll be using free tier stuff for the most part!) to get the most out of this workshop.

### Prerequisites

- Please bring your laptop for the hands-on workshop.
- An Azure subscription is required (but we'll be using free tier for the most part)
