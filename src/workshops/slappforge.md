# Remote debugging of live AWS Lambda functions

*Learn how to use open source technology to add remote debugging to your favorite IDE for AWS Lambda.*

The workshop will cover a short history of debugging techniques along with current indirect
debugging methods such as using CloudWatch Logs, X-ray, console print statements and
observability tools, as well as local simulation of a Lambda runtime environment. While indirect
methods can certainly help, they do not provide the same level of information engineers are
accustomed to, or might require, especially to effectively investigate complex scenarios - which
necessitates debugging in the first place.

Following the initial introductory session, a hands-on demonstration of live remote debugging
will be performed for lambda functions developed in NodeJS and Java. Attendees will have
access to instructions on how to configure their IDE for remote debugging and together we’ll
step through a representative debugging session for an AWS Lambda function.

Attendees will require free registration with SLAppForge to use the Sigma IDE, and could also
try out the support for external IDEs such as WebStorm or IntelliJ IDEA with Lambda functions
in NodeJS. For Lambda functions in Java, attendees can use almost any standard Java IDE
such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or NetBeans.

Learning objectives will be:

* Understand the current state of debugging AWS functions using CloudWatch, X-Ray,
print statements, observability tools and local simulation tools.
* Review the requirements for remote debugging -- Lambda proxy, local client, broker
server, access/secret keys & environment variables.
* Methods to add open source technology to your current IDE to perform true live remote
debugging.
* Understand debugging considerations or limitations for AWS Lambda.
